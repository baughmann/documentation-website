# Discover 

**Discover** in OpenSearch Dashboards helps you extract insights and get value out of data assets across your organization. You can ingest and query your data, display that data in visualizations and interactive dashboards, and deliver insights. 

Discover is an internal plugin in the Dashboards core. Its three primary functions enable you to:

1. Select data for exploration, set a time range for that data, search it with the [Dashboards Query Language (DQL)]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/dashboards/dql/), and filter the results.
2. Explore the data's details, view individual documents, and create tables summarizing the data's contents.
3. Present the findings in a visualization.
